#+TITLE: Notes on Containerization with Docker

These notes are taken from the book "*The Docker Book  Containerization is the new virtualization*" by *James Turnbull*

- Docker on IRC: irc.freenode.net and channel #docker


* Docker components:
- A native linux container format that Docker calls libcontainer
- Linux kernel namespaces -> provide isolation for filesystems, processes, and networks
- Filesystem isolation -> each container is its own root filesystem
- Process isolation -> each container is its own process environment
- Network isolation -> separate virtual interfaces and IP addressing between containers
- Resourse isolation and grouping -> resourses like CPU and memory are allocated individually to each Docker container (using [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups][cgroups]], or control groups, kernel feature)
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-on-write][Copy-on-write]] -> File systems are created with copy-on-write
- Logging -> STDOUT, STDERR, and STDIN from container are logged and are available for analysis
- Interactive shell
