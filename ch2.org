#+TITLE: Docker Images and Repositories

- Docker image is made up of filesystems layered over each other
- At the base is boot filesystem (*bootfs*). When a container has booted, it is moved into memory, and the boot filesystem is unmounted to free up the RAM used by initrd disc image
- Next, docker layers a root filesystem (*rootfs*) on top of bootfs. This rootfs can be one or more operating system
- Docker uses [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_mount][union mount]] to add one or more read-only filesystems on top of rootfs. The union mount overlays the filesystem on top of one another
- Docker calls these filesystems images. Images can be layered on top of one another
- The image below is called 'parent image'. We can traverse the images till we reach the end, and the last image is called 'base image'

* Docker repositories
- Docker repository is similar to git repository. It contains number of images, metadata, and layers
- We use the command `docker pull` to pull the image from Docker hub
